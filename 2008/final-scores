These 19 participants were able to distinguish between the synthetic ECGs
with high and low amounts of TWA, and their entries were used to create
the final reference ranking for the Challenge data set, available at
http://physionet.org/challenge/2008/reference-ranks .  Their scores,
as shown above, are calculated as the Kendall rank correlation coefficient
between their rankings of the entire data set and the final reference ranking.
A score above 0.436, achieved by 21 participants, is significant (p > 0.99),
given the final reference ranking used here.

The recipients of the scores marked with asterisks (*) have contributed the
sources for their TWA analysis software for use and further study;  they are
available at http://physionet.org/challenge/2008/sources/ .
