### George Moody

**Winners of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2005** *(Oct. 4, 2005,
midnight)*

The winners of the [PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge
2005](/2005/) are R Povinelli of
Marquette University, and the team of C Raab, N Wessel, A Schirdewan,
and J Kurths of the University of Potsdam. Learn more at the [Challenge
2005](/2005/) home page.

## Introduction

Our popular series of challenges presented in cooperation with
[Computers in Cardiology](http://www.cinc.org/) continues this year in a
new mode. Participants are invited to choose one of the five previous
challenges as a topic for a follow-up study:

-   [Detecting sleep apnea from the ECG](/2000)
-   [Predicting paroxysmal atrial
    fibrillation](/2001)
-   [RR interval time series modeling](/2002)
-   [Distinguishing ischemic from non-ischemic ST
    changes](/2003)
-   [Spontaneous termination of atrial
    fibrillation](/2004)

The problems posed by these challenges have continued to interest many
researchers long after the final deadlines have passed. We encourage you
to read the papers published by previous challenge participants in the
Computers in Cardiology proceedings and elsewhere, and to build upon
this work in pursuit of even better solutions. This year, we will
recognize the most outstanding papers inspired by a previous challenge,
with special awards to be presented at Computers in Cardiology.

With knowledge gained from previously published papers, can you advance
the state of the art further, either by combining efforts with other
participants or by entirely new methods?

### Organization of the Challenge

The data sets used for these challenges remain available; note, however,
that the correct classifications, which were withheld during the
original challenges, have also been posted. Pariticipants may wish to
consider using additional relevant data from PhysioBank or other
sources, or alternative methods of objectively evaluating their work.

Abstracts of the papers submitted for the original challenges are also
available on the pages containing the results for each challenge, and
the complete papers are available in proceedings of Computers in
Cardiology 2000 through 2004 (available on-line to IEEE members and
subscribing institutions via [IEEE
Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)). Read these papers to learn what
has been done already.

### How to enter

1.  Choose one of the [challenge topics](../#past-challenges) and get to
    work!
2.  Write and submit an abstract describing your work following the
    instructions on the [Computers in Cardiology web
    site](http://www.cinc.org/). Please select “Computers in Cardiology
    Challenge” as the topic of your abstract, so that it can be
    identified easily by the abstract review committee. The abstract
    submission deadline is 2 May 2005.
3.  Write and submit a complete paper describing your work, again
    following the instructions on the [Computers in Cardiology web
    site](http://www.cinc.org/). To permit sufficient time for all
    entries to be judged, your manuscript must be submitted no later
    than 1 August 2005.

Participants will present their work at Computers in Cardiology in
September. The authors of the two best entries presented at the
conference, as determined by a jury convened for this purpose, will
receive awards of US\$500. Awards will be presented during the final
plenary session of the conference on Wednesday, 28 September 2005, at
which time a new challenge for 2006 will be announced.

### Important dates

Late submissions will not be accepted.

**Monday, 2 May 2005**
:   Deadline for submission of abstracts for Computers in
    Cardiology 2005.

**Monday, 1 August 2005, noon GMT**
:   Deadline for submission of completed papers.

**Sunday-Wednesday, 25-28 September 2005**
:   Computers in Cardiology, Lyon, France.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to follow the rules of the original Challenge for my chosen
topic?**

Absolutely not! You are encouraged to take the ideas, and perhaps some
of the data, explored by the original challenge and do something novel
with them.

You do need to follow the rules of *this year’s* challenge, however.

**Are papers submitted for the Rosanna Degani Young Investigator Award
also eligible for the Challenge Awards?**

Yes. Note that the YIA deadline for submission of completed papers is 2
May 2005; you will need to work quickly!

**May I revise my completed paper before publication?**

We follow the example of the YIA, which we paraphrase here.

> Your paper will not be printed other than in the Conference
> Proceedings (the Abstract Book will contain your abstract and not your
> paper). Therefore you may revise your paper during the summer, you may
> improve the style and the language, remove errors, and even add more
> data. Since the original paper, however, determines if you will
> receive an award, we have to ask you not to abuse this freedom.

The final version of your paper must be submitted before the conclusion
of the conference on Wednesday, 28 September 2005.

### Challenge Results

**4 October 2005:** The winners of this challenge were RJ Povinelli, of
