# Leaderboard for the 2024 Challenge

This leaderboard contains the [Challenge scores](../#scoring) on the [validation data](../#data) for the [official phase](../#rules) entries to the [2024 Challenge](../).

The MATLAB example code is available [here](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/matlab-example-2024),
the Python example code is available [here](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/python-example-2024),
and the vanilla deep learning approach is available
[here](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/example-classifier-2024). These
are minimal working examples to demonstrate the code, and to serve as a
template to the teams, but not for comparisons; they are deliberately designed
not to perform well.
