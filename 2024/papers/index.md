# Digitization and Classification of ECG Images: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2024

## Citations

We ask teams to cite the description and data papers for the Challenge to ensure that your readers can better understand the context for your approaches.

__For this year's Challenge, please cite the Challenge description paper:__

The above paper is a draft. We will update it soon to include information about the conclusion of the Challenge.

__For this year's Challenge data, please cite the Challenge data paper:__

[Reyna MA, Deepanshi, Weigle J, Koscova Z, Campbell K, Shivashankara KK, et al. ECG-Image-Database: A dataset of ECG images with real-world imaging and scanning artifacts; a foundation for computerized ECG image digitization and analysis, 2024. URL https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16612.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16612)

The above paper is a draft. We will update it soon to include more information about the data.

## Preparing Your Paper

Please follow the [preparation and submission instructions](https://www.cinc.org/instructions-for-preparing-and-submitting-full-papers/) for your CinC papers.

We have prepared templates to help you prepare your CinC paper. Please use the LaTeX template ([Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bqsnzsqcytvg#c9d13c) or [download](cinc_template.zip)) or the [Word template](https://cinc.org/instructions-for-preparing-and-submitting-full-papers/). These [templates](cinc_template.pdf) include important instructions, advice, and references. Please use this [checklist](cinc_paper_checklist.pdf) to check your paper.

Please *read* and follow the templates. Each year, we need to provide feedback for many teams that miss some of the paper requirements, and each year, some papers are unfortunately rejected because the teams were unable to address important issues that the conference required.

## Conference Papers

The conference papers for [Computing in Cardiology 2024](https://www.cinc2024.org/) will be available on the [CinC](https://www.cinc.org/cinc-papers-on-line/) website.
