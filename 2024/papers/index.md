## Preparing Your Paper

Please follow the [preparation and submission instructions](https://www.cinc.org/instructions-for-preparing-and-submitting-full-papers/) for your CinC papers.

We will share templates and checklists to help you prepare your CinC paper.

Please *read* and follow one of the templates. Each year, we need to provide feedback for many teams that miss some of the paper requirements, and each year, some papers are unfortunately rejected because the teams were unable to address important issues that the conference required.

## Conference Papers

The conference papers for [Computing in Cardiology 2024](https://www.cinc2024.org/) will be available on the [CinC](https://www.cinc.org/cinc-papers-on-line/) and [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000157/all-proceedings) websites.
