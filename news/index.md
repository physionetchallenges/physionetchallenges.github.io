- <a name="2024.09.20"></a>__September 20, 2024:__ We have released (__and updated__) the [results](../2024/results) of the 2024 Challenge. Congratulations to the winners! Please see the [announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/c/bEjPLIMagRk) for more details.

- <a name="2024.08.19"></a>__August 19, 2024:__ We have extended the official phase deadline to 23:59 GMT on August 21, 2024. Please see the [deadlines](../2024/#key-dates-deadlines) for the updated deadlines.

- <a name="2024.07.09"></a>__July 9, 2024:__ The PhysioNet Challenges spent several days last month at [Data Science Africa 2024](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2024nyeri/). The [DSAIL](https://dekut-dsail.github.io/) at [DeKUT](https://www.dkut.ac.ke/) helped us to run a hackathon over 4 days with more than 50 attendees, including some that we will win a prize from the [IEEE SPS](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/data-challenges/digitization-and-classification-ecg-images-george-b-moody) at [CinC 2024](https://cinc2024.org). Please see [this announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/c/_-V_t1srd-o) for more information about our trip to DSA.

- <a name="2024.06.14"></a>__June 14, 2024:__ Abstract decisions for CinC 2024 have been announced, and the official scoring system is open with a new validation data set that includes images of real paper ECGs. Please [submit](../2024/submissions) entries early and often; although you have 10 entries in the scoring system, we may limit each team to one request or deprioritize additional entries from a team in the final week because of the large numbers of entries that we receive in the final days of the Challenge, and because teams that enter earlier tend to perform better!

- <a name="2024.06.06"></a>__June 6, 2024:__  We have just completed a 3-day workshop [at this year's annual DSA meeting in Nyeri, Kenya](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2024nyeri/blog/summer-school). As part of this capacity-building initiative, we provided another working solution to the ECG image classification task. The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/vanilla-cnn-2024). The Challenge teams are welcome to use any part of this code in their entry, but we strongly suggest trying other approaches as well. In particular, we deliberately under-designed the model, which does not attempt to digitize the data for classification. We have posted this only to provide a working example, and not as a high bar to beat.

- <a name="2024.05.24"></a>__May 24, 2024:__ The official phase of the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2024](../2024/) has begun! We have made many updates to make the Challenge more accessible and more realistic. Please see our announcement on the [Challenge forum](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/c/m4vc1cuumq4) for more details and begin submitting your updated entries in the coming days.
