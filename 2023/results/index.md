# Results for the 2023 Challenge

This page contains the scores for the 2023 PhysioNet Challenge.

During the course of the Challenge, teams submitted entries with their approaches, and we trained and evaluated each entry on the [Challenge data](../#data). The training set was public, and the validation and test sets were hidden.

During the [unofficial and official phases](../#rules) of the Challenge, we trained each entry on the training set, and we [scored](../#scoring) each entry on the validation set. After the official phase, each team selected one entry for evaluation on the test set, and we evaluated these entries on the test set.

Teams that satisfied all of the [Challenge rules](../#rules) were eligible for rankings and prizes as official Challenge entries. Teams that did not satisfy one or more of the rules were not eligible for rankings or prizes as unofficial Challenge entries. (Both the official and unofficial entries are from the official phase of the Challenge.)

__The officially eligible team with the highest Challenge score at 72 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) won the 2023 Challenge.__
