# George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges

For the past 24 years, [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org) and [Computing in Cardiology](http://www.cinc.org/) have co-hosted a series of annual challenges, now called the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges](/about/), to tackle clinically interesting questions that are either unsolved or not well-solved.

The [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023](/2023/) invites participants to predict outcomes for comatose patients in the hours following resuscitation from cardiac arrest.

We ask participants to design and implement working, open-source algorithms that, based only on the provided electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and routine patient data, can predict good and poor outcomes for patients. The team with the best score for this task on the hidden test set wins the Challenge.

Please check the below links for information about [current](#current) and [past](#past) Challenges, including [important details](/faq/) about scoring and test data for previous Challenges.
