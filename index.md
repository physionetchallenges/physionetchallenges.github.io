# George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges

For the past 27 years, [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org) and [Computing in Cardiology](http://www.cinc.org/) have co-hosted a series of annual challenges, now called the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges](about), to tackle clinically interesting but unsolved questions.

The [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2026](2026) invites teams to develop and implement open-source algorithms for using PSGs to predict future diagnoses of cognitive impairment. Chagas disease is a parasitic disease in Central and South America that affects an estimated 6.5 million people and causes nearly 10,000 deaths annually. Timely treatment may prevent or slow damage to the cardiovascular system, but serological testing capacity is limited, so detection through ECGs can help to identify Chagas patients for testing and treatment. We ask participants to design and implement working, open-source algorithms that, based only on the provided ECGs, prioritize patients for serological testing. The teams with the best scores for these tasks on the hidden test set win the Challenge.

Please check the below links for information about [current](#current) and [past](#past) Challenges, including [important details](faq) about scoring and test data for previous Challenges.
