# George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges

For the past 25 years, [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org) and [Computing in Cardiology](http://www.cinc.org/) have co-hosted a series of annual challenges, now called the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges](about), to tackle clinically interesting but unsolved questions.

The [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2024](2024) invites teams to develop algorithms for digitizing and classifying electrocardiograms (ECGs) captured from images or paper printouts. Despite recent advances in digital ECG devices, paper or physical ECGs remain common, especially in the Global South. These paper ECGs document the history and diversity of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and algorithms that can digitize and classify these images have the potential to improve our understanding and treatment of CVDs, especially for underrepresented and underserved populations.

We ask participants to design and implement working, open-source algorithms that, based only on the provided ECG images, reconstruct the waveforms and/or classify or diagnose the images. The teams with the best scores for these tasks on the hidden test set win the Challenge.

Please check the below links for information about [current](#current) and [past](#past) Challenges, including [important details](faq) about scoring and test data for previous Challenges.

- <a name="2024.06.14"></a>__June 14, 2024:__ Abstract decisions for CinC 2024 have been announced, and the official scoring system is open with a new validation data set that includes images of real paper ECGs. Please [submit](2024/submissions) entries early and often; although you have 10 entries in the scoring system, we may limit each team to one request or deprioritize additional entries from a team in the final week because of the large numbers of entries that we receive in the final days of the Challenge, and because teams that enter earlier tend to perform better!

- <a name="2024.06.06"></a>__June 6, 2024:__  We have just completed a 3-day workshop [at this year's annual DSA meeting in Nyeri, Kenya](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2024nyeri/blog/summer-school). As part of this capacity-building initiative, we provided another working solution to the ECG image classification task. The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/example-classifier-2024). The Challenge teams are welcome to use any part of this code in their entry, but we strongly suggest trying other approaches as well. In particular, we deliberately under-designed the model, which does not attempt to digitize the data for classification. We have posted this only to provide a working example, and not as a high bar to beat.

- <a name="2024.05.24"></a>__May 24, 2024:__ The official phase of the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2024](/2024/) has begun! We have made many updates to make the Challenge more accessible and more realistic. Please see our announcement on the [Challenge forum](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/c/m4vc1cuumq4) for more details and begin submitting your updated entries in the coming days.

- <a name="2024.03.14"></a>__March 15, 2024:__ We are delighted to announce that the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges](2024/#conference-attendance) are partnering with [Data Science Africa](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/) (DSA) and the [IEEE Signal Processing Society's Challenges and Data Collections Committee](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/challenges-and-data-collections) (CDCC). The [IEEE CDCC is supporting this year's Challenge](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/data-challenges/digitization-and-classification-ecg-images-george-b-moody) with additional cash prizes for participating teams from Africa, and the Challenge organizers will be running a [workshop at this year's annual DSA meeting in Kenya](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2024nyeri/blog/summer-school) from June 2-5, 2024. Please note that we are also accepting (and scoring) entries, and there are two deadlines coming up: April 8, 2024 to submit a [preliminary entry to the Challenge](2024/submissions) and April 15, 2024 to submit a (placeholder) [abstract to CinC](https://cinc.org/inf_authors/).

- <a name="2024.02.29"></a>__February 29, 2024:__ We are [now accepting](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/c/hhTSHmAVjAY) unofficial phase submissions for the 2024 Challenge. Please read the [submissions instructions](2024/submissions), double check your code, and [submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFZNXv5rc-KlBxZMBB5IX8jRWHR-hADuheOtRWs5x1XzZo4w/viewform?usp=sf_link) your code when ready.

- <a name="2024.01.25"></a>__January 25, 2024:__ The NIH-funded George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2024 is [now open](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/c/PBaLtvnwuRA)! Please read this website for details and share questions and comments on [Challenge forum](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/). This year's Challenge is generously sponsored by [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- <a name="2023.10.10"></a>__October 10, 2023:__ The winners of the 2023 Challenge were announced on 4 October 2023 at [CinC 2023](https://cinc2023.org) in Atlanta, GA, USA. Congratulations, teams! See the [results](2023/results) and [papers](2023/papers) as well as the [full announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/physionet-challenges/c/9FRZp9wbnKo) for the final steps in this year's Challenge.
