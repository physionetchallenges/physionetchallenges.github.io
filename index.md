# George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges

For the past 23 years, [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org) and [Computing in Cardiology](http://www.cinc.org/) have co-hosted a series of annual challenges, now called the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges](/about/), to tackle clinically interesting questions that are either unsolved or not well-solved.

The [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022](/2022/) invites participants to identify murmurs in heart sound recordings collected from multiple auscultation locations.

We ask participants to design and implement a working, open-source algorithm that, based only on the provided recordings and routine demographic data, can determine whether any murmurs are audible from a patient's recordings. We have designed a scoring function that reflects the burden of algorithmic pre-screening, expert screening, treatment, and missed diagnoses. The team with the lowest score wins the Challenge.

Please check the below links for information about [current](#current) and [past](#past) Challenges, including [important details](/faq/) about scoring and test data for previous Challenges.
