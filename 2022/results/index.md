# Results for the 2022 Challenge

This page contains the scores for the 2022 PhysioNet Challenge.

We trained and scored each entry on the [Challenge data](../#data). We trained each entry on the training set and scored each entry on the training, validation, and test sets. The training set was public, and the validation and test sets were hidden.

Teams that satisfied all of the [Challenge rules](../#rules) were eligible for rankings and prizes as official Challenge entries. Teams that did not satisfy one or more of the rules are not eligible for rankings or prizes as unofficial Challenge entries.
