# Tables of final scores

The final scores for the 2020 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge are in the following tables:
1. [The official scores](physionet_2020_official_scores.csv)
2. [The unofficial scores](physionet_2020_unofficial_scores.csv)
3. [The metrics per database of the official entries](physionet_2020_metrics_perDatabase_official_entries.csv )
4. [The per-class scoring metrics of the official entries on the validation data](physionet_2020_validation_metrics_by_class_official_entries.csv)

We introduced a [new scoring metric](https://physionetchallenges.github.io/2020/#scoring) for this Challenge. We used this scoring metric to evaluate and rank the Challenge entries. We included several other metrics for reference. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC), and _F_-measure scores are the macro-average of the scores across all classes. The accuracy metric is the fraction of correctly diagnosed recordings, i.e., all classes for the recording are correct. These metrics were computed by the [evaluate_12ECG_score.py](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/evaluation-2020/blob/master/evaluate_12ECG_score.py) script. Please see the script for more details of these scores.

We included the scores on the following datasets: 

1. __Validation Set:__ Includes recordings from the hidden CPSC and G12EC sets.
2. __Hidden CPSC Set:__ Split between the validation and test sets.
3. __Hidden G12EC Set:__ Split between the validation and test sets.
4. __Hidden Undisclosed Set:__ All recordings were part of the test sets.
5. __Test Set:__ Includes recordings from the hidden CPSC, G12EC, and undisclosed test sets.

In these tables, you can find the following information:

1. Official entries that were scored on the validation and test data and ranked in the Challenge:
[physionet_2020_official_scores.csv](physionet_2020_official_scores.csv)
2. Unofficial entries that were scored on the validation and test data but unranked because they did not satisfy all of the [rules](https://physionetchallenges.github.io/2020/#rules-and-deadlines) or were unsuccessful on one or more of the test sets:
[physionet_2020_unofficial_scores.csv](physionet_2020_unofficial_scores.csv)
3. Challenge and other scoring metrics on all official entries broken with scores for each database in the validation and test data: 
[physionet_2020_metrics_perDatabase_official_entries.csv](physionet_2020_metrics_perDatabase_official_entries.csv )
4. Per-class scoring metrics on the validation data:
[physionet_2020_validation_metrics_by_class_official_entries.csv](physionet_2020_validation_metrics_by_class_official_entries.csv)
