Challenge Live images

 This directory contains live CD/DVD/USB images that can be used for
 testing PhysioNet Challenge entries.  These are bootable disk images
 containing a Debian GNU/Linux system with all of the same software as
 is used in the Challenge sandbox environment.

 The live system also includes a basic X11 desktop environment,
 including a web browser, file manager, and various other tools; note
 that this software is not present in the Challenge sandbox system.

 (For details about exactly what software is included in the sandbox
 environment, see http://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/.)

 In addition, the live system includes the training data for the
 current (2014) Challenge, installed in /usr/database/set-p/.

 The live system requires an x86_64 CPU (Intel or AMD), as that is the
 architecture we use for the Challenge sandbox system.


Creating a bootable disk
------------------------

 To create a bootable DVD from a recent GNU/Linux system, run the
 command 'wodim binary.hybrid.iso', or use your favorite burning tool
 to write the raw .iso file to a blank recordable DVD.  If you're not
 using wodim, be sure that you are writing the ISO image as-is (select
 the "burn ISO image" option or similar), rather than creating a new
 ISO filesystem with a single file on it.

 Note also that as of version 0.4, the ISO image is too large to fit
 on a standard CD-R or CD-RW; you will need to use either a DVD or a
 non-standard "99-minute" recordable CD.  (The latter has not been
 tested and may require you to specify the '-overburn' option to
 wodim.)

 To create a bootable USB disk from a GNU/Linux system, first run the
 command 'ls /dev/disk/by-id/usb-*'.  This will list all USB disks
 currently attached to the system, as well as any partitions on those
 disks; for example:

   /dev/disk/by-id/usb-Yoyodyne_UltraFlash_123456789-0:0
   /dev/disk/by-id/usb-Yoyodyne_UltraFlash_123456789-0:0-part1

 You will need to write to the raw device (in this case,
 '/dev/disk/by-id/usb-Yoyodyne_UltraFlash_123456789-0:0'), not to the
 partition ('-part1').  Note that this will delete all other data on
 the disk, so be certain that this is the disk you're intending to
 use.  Then, as root, run the following command, substituting the name
 of your device:

   dd if=binary.hybrid.iso of=/dev/disk/by-id/usb-Yoyodyne_UltraFlash_123456789-0:0


Building
--------

 If you prefer, you can build your own version of the live DVD.  This
 allows you to customize the environment, install additional software
 (or omit packages you don't need), or build a version for a different
 CPU architecture.

 To do this, you will first need a working Debian system.  (Other
 Debian-derived distributions such as Ubuntu may also work, but we
 have not tested them.)  Installing Debian is outside the scope of
 this document.

 Before starting, be sure you have at least 10 GB of free disk space.

  - Install the 'live-build' package through your package manager.

  - Download and unpack 'source.debian-live.tar.bz2'.  This will
    create a directory called 'source/debian-live' including a
    subdirectory called 'config'.

  - Edit the files in the 'config' directory as appropriate:

     - To build a live system for a different CPU architecture, edit
       'config/bootstrap' and change LB_ARCHITECTURES to the
       corresponding Debian architecture (e.g., "i386" or "powerpc".)
       Note that we haven't tested and don't support any architectures
       other than amd64.

     - Edit the files in 'config/package-lists' to add or remove
       packages from the system.

     - You can also install non-Debian packages; look at the files in
       'config/hooks' for some examples.

     - If you're not intending to distribute your modified live DVD,
       you can edit 'config/source' and change LB_SOURCE to "false".
       This prevents live-build from creating the source package
       archives, saving some time and network bandwidth.

     - See http://live.debian.net/manual/stable/ for more information.

  - When you're ready, 'cd' to the source/debian-live directory and
    run (as root) 'lb clean && lb build'.  Expect that this will take
    at least an hour or two to complete, depending on your system and
    your Internet connection.
