Case 1:
extent: 31%
segments: 1 2 3 8 9 13 14 15
centroid: 8

Case 2:
extent: 30%
segments: 3 4 9 10
centroid: 3 or 4 or 9 or 10 *

Case 3:
extent: 52%
segments: 3 4 5 9 10 11 12 15 16
centroid: 10 or 11 **

Case 4:
extent: 14%
segments: 1 9 10 11 15 17
centroid: 15

* For case 2, the centroid appears to be at the intersection
of segments 3, 4, 9, and 10.  An entry reporting any one of these
four segments as the centroid would be scored as correct (CED = 0
for case 2).

** For case 3, the centroid appears to be on the common border
of segments 10 and 11.  An entry reporting either of these
two segments as the centroid would be scored as correct (CED = 0
for case 3).
